# Suleat

*A social app for sharing food tastes and experiences.*

## Overview

Suleat is a Filipino photo-sharing social networking service. It is primarily catered for people with interests in all things culinary, allowing users to upload photos or sets of photos, be organized by "flavor tags", and be associated with a location via user input. All posts can be seen publicly, and users can browse other users' content by their profile or flavor tags or unique URLs that each post contains. It is Clerk-operated image-centric social networking service that, as of the moment, only operates in English.
